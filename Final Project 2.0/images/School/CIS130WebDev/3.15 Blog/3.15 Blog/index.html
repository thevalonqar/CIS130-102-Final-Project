        “Dance music is more improvisatory. It uses on extendable structure which on the one hand is recognisable, and on the other, improvisatory. It’s based on hearing what you do while you do it. In most compositions, it’s based on hearing things in a much more distanced sense.
        Indian music is a different form of repetition again. You sit down and listen to it all the way through, and it goes into you and builds up into a total effect. African music is different again. You get the sense that the repetition is a social thing that expresses not an individual consciousness but a community.”</p>
