        <h2>ABOUT HIM</h2>
        <p style="text-indent:45px">
          Russell was born and raised in Oskaloosa, Iowa. As a child and adolescent, he studied the cello and piano and began to compose his own music. When he was 18 he moved to San Francisco, where he lived in a Buddhist commune. After earning his high school equivalency, he studied North Indian classical music at the Ali Akbar College of Music and Western composition part-time at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He met Allen Ginsberg, with whom he began to work, accompanying him on the cello as a soloist or in groups while Ginsberg sang or read his poetry.

          In the mid-late 70s, Russell became the music director of The Kitchen, a downtown NYC avant-garde performance space, where he booked experimental artists and composers but also well-known acts like The Talking Heads and The Modern Lovers. During this time Russell became very interested and influenced by early disco music. A lifelong passion of Russell's was bringing together musical influences as wide and disparate as disco, experimental/avant garde music, pop music, and western and eastern classical composition.

          Russell went on to anonymously publish several different one-hit-wonder radio disco tracks. He continued composing and recording his own music in his personal home studio. In the late 80s his creative output declined as his HIV developed into AIDS. In 1992 Russell died penniless and unknown to the masses. Famous friends, collaborators, and lovers of Russell's, such as Phillip Glass, Allen Ginsberg, and David Byrne helped release Russell's self recordings in the late 90s and early 2000s. In the past decade many current artists have stated their influence and inspiration drawn from Russell including LCD Soundsystem, Kanye West, and Panda Bear.
